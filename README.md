# The Culture

### What is The Culture?
This is the repo for my website in progress, **The Culture**. 

### What is the Vision?
The Vision of The Culture is to serve as an outlet for businesses owned by people of Color. The Culture will allow these businesses to market their products. Along with product marketing, customers who have gotten a chance to use a product by a certain company can share their experience, giving prospective customers a better idea of what they are looking for in a product, as well as what they can expect if they purchase a certain product.
